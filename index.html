		<p style="background-color:lightgreen;">Winding its way among countless islands, and imbedded in mountains, the "holy lake" extended a dozen leagues still further to the south. With the high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of the water, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the adventurer to the banks of the Hudson, at a point where, with the usual obstructions of the rapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the language of the country, the river became navigable to the tide.</p>

Their progress, in consequence, was proportionate; and long before the twilight gathered about them, they had made good many toilsome miles on their return.</p>
